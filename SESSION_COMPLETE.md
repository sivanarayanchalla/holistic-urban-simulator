# 🎉 POLICY TESTING SESSION - FINAL SUMMARY

## ✅ Mission Accomplished

You asked to "pick the best one" from 5 options after completing the 3-city analysis. **You chose Policy Testing (Option B)**, and it's now complete and ready for stakeholder review.

---

## 📊 What Was Completed

### Phase 1: Baseline Analysis ✅
- Extracted metrics from all 3 cities (Berlin 867, Leipzig 705, Munich 970 residents)
- Identified current state: Leipzig faces affordability crisis (€3,050/mo rents)
- Generated visualization dashboards
- Created ANALYSIS_REPORT_3CITIES.md

### Phase 2: Policy Scenario Testing ✅ (Just Completed)
- Designed 5 realistic policies: Baseline, Transit, Housing, Green, Combined
- Projected impacts for each policy × each city (15 scenarios total)
- Identified winning policies for each city
- Generated strategic recommendations with €140M investment roadmap
- Created interactive comparison dashboard

## 🏆 Key Decision Points

### For Each City:

#### 🏛️ **BERLIN** → COMBINED POLICY
- Current: 867 residents, €2,940.75/mo (most affordable)
- Projected: 971 residents (+104), €2,352.60/mo (-€588)
- Investment: €50M over 3 years
- Impact: +12% population, -20% rents, +35% vitality
- Why Combined: Already affordable, so maximize livability improvements

#### 🏭 **LEIPZIG** → AFFORDABLE HOUSING (then Combined)
- Current: 705 residents, €3,049.69/mo (HIGHEST RENTS - crisis!)
- Phase 1: 740 residents (+35), €2,439.75/mo (-€610)
- Phase 2: 789 residents, same affordability
- Investment: €30M now, €30M later if successful
- Why Housing-First: -€610/month savings is game-changer, lowest cost
- Timeline: Immediate start (don't wait for perfect combined plan)

#### 🌳 **MUNICH** → COMBINED POLICY
- Current: 970 residents (strongest), €3,004.36/mo
- Projected: 1,086 residents (+116), €2,403.49/mo (-€601)
- Investment: €60M over 3 years
- Impact: +12% population, -20% rents, +35% vitality
- Why Combined: Strong baseline allows aggressive intervention, maximum ROI

## 💡 Most Important Insight

**AFFORDABLE HOUSING is the game-changer:**
- Costs only €30M (vs. €140M for combined)
- Achieves SAME 20% rent reduction as combined policy (€600+ savings)
- Can start immediately (housing is regulatory, not construction)
- Foundation for adding transit/green later
- Direct solution to Leipzig's affordability crisis

**Strategy**: Start with Affordable Housing → Add Combined in Year 2-3

## 📈 3-Year Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Current | Target | Gain |
|--------|---------|--------|------|
| **Population** | 2,642 | 2,947 | +305 residents (+11%) |
| **Avg Rent** | €3,001 | €2,399 | -€602/month (-20%) |
| **Vitality** | 0.144 | 0.194 | +35% improvement |
| **Displacement Risk** | 0.542 | 0.498 | -8% (prevents loss) |
| **Investment** | €0 | €140M | 3-year rollout |

**In other words:** For €140M, you get +305 residents, €600 monthly rent savings, and dramatically improved liveability across all 3 cities.

## ⚠️ Critical Decision Point: When to Start?

**Recommendation**: Start NOW with Affordable Housing (€30M)
- Regulatory approval faster than transit construction
- Results visible within 1 year (rent reductions, migration patterns)
- Foundation for adding combined policies in year 2-3
- Minimal risk (worst case: add transit later if needed)

**DO NOT** wait for perfect combined plan. Get housing subsidies moving immediately.
