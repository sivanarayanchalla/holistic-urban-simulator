### 3. **Affordable Housing** (-20% rents)
- Subsidize housing programs
- Impact: Population +5.0%, Rent -20%, Displacement -8%

### 4. **Green Infrastructure** (+25% green space)
- Parks, green corridors, environmental improvements
- Impact: Population +2.5%, Vitality +20%

### 5. **Combined Policy** (All interventions)

## Projected Outcomes by City

### BERLIN (Most Affordable, Mid-Sized)
```
Baseline          Population: 867    Rent: €2,940.75
Combined Policy   Population: 971 (+104, +12%)  Rent: €2,352.60 (-€588, -20%)
```
- **Recommendation**: COMBINED POLICY
- **Rationale**: Strongest growth (+12%) while cutting rents. Berlin's already-affordable baseline allows maximum livability improvement
- **Alternative**: Affordable Housing alone (lower cost, +5% growth)

### LEIPZIG (Highest Rents, Smallest)
```
Baseline          Population: 705    Rent: €3,049.69
Affordable        Population: 740 (+35, +5%)   Rent: €2,439.75 (-€610, -20%)
Combined Policy   Population: 789 (+84, +12%)  Rent: €2,439.75
```
- **Recommendation**: AFFORDABLE HOUSING (primary), COMBINED (if budget allows)
- **Rationale**: Faces affordability crisis (€3,050/mo). Housing subsidy directly addresses issue. €610/month savings critical for resident retention.
- **Priority**: Housing subsidy first, add transit later if funds available

### MUNICH (Strongest Performance, Largest)
```
Baseline          Population: 970    Rent: €3,004.36
Combined Policy   Population: 1,086 (+116, +12%)  Rent: €2,403.49 (-€601, -20%)
```
- **Recommendation**: COMBINED POLICY
- **Rationale**: Strongest momentum (970 baseline). Combined approach leverages growth potential: +116 residents, rents cut 20%, vitality soars 35%
- **Alternative**: Transit Investment alone (+44 residents, no rent relief)

## Policy Impact Comparison

| Policy | Pop Growth | Rent Impact | Vitality | Displacement | Cost |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|------|
| Baseline | 0% | 0% | Base | Base | €0 |
| Transit | +4.5% | 0% | +15% | Same | €€€€ |
| Affordable Housing | +5.0% | -20% | Same | -8% | €€ |
| Green Infrastructure | +2.5% | +2% | +20% | Same | €€ |
| **Combined** | **+12.0%** | **-20%** | **+35%** | **-8%** | €€€€€ |

**Cost-Effectiveness Ranking**:
1. 🥇 **Green Infrastructure** (low cost, high livability)
2. 🥈 **Affordable Housing** (medium cost, high affordability)
3. 🥉 **Transit Investment** (high cost, wide benefits)
4. 💎 **Combined Policy** (highest cost, maximum impact)

## Key Insights

### Population Dynamics
- ✅ All policies show positive population response
- ✅ Combined policy universally most effective (+12%)
- ✅ Housing subsidies provide 5% growth at lower cost

### Affordability Crisis
- ⚠️ Leipzig faces severe unaffordability (€3,050/mo)
- ✅ Affordable Housing policy cuts all rents 20% (€2,350-2,440 range)
- ✅ €600/month savings transforms market competitiveness

### Vitality & Livability
- ✅ Green infrastructure adds +20-35% vitality
- ✅ Displacement risk drops 8% with housing affordability
- ✅ Combined approach holistically addresses livability

### Equity Considerations
- ✅ Affordable housing most directly prevents displacement
- ✅ Transit investment benefits all residents (mobility equity)
- ✅ Green spaces improve environmental justice
- ⚠️ Need sustained funding to prevent displacement cycles

## Implementation Roadmap

### **IMMEDIATE (Months 1-3)**
1. Secure €140M funding across 3 cities
2. Finalize transit expansion plans
3. Launch affordable housing subsidy framework
4. Green space audit & planning

### **SHORT-TERM (Months 4-12)**
1. Begin transit infrastructure (Phase 1)
2. Distribute housing subsidies in highest-need areas
3. Plant trees and create green corridors

### **MEDIUM-TERM (Year 2)**
1. Complete transit Phase 1
2. Evaluate housing program effectiveness
3. Scale successful interventions

### **LONG-TERM (Year 3+)**
1. Full combined policy implementation
2. Monitor displacement risk closely
3. Adjust based on community feedback

### **Budget Allocation**
- Berlin: €50M (combined policy, housing-focused)
- Leipzig: €30M (housing subsidy primary)
- Munich: €60M (combined policy, growth-focused)
- **Total**: €140M

### **Expected 3-Year Outcomes**
- Population growth: +305 residents (4%, 9%, 12% by city)
- Rent reduction: 20% across all 3 cities
- Vitality improvement: +35% (combined policy areas)
- Displacement prevention: 8% reduction in risk

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Housing subsidies attract migration → cost inflation | Phased implementation, annual budget review |
| Transit requires municipal coordination | Establish regional transport authority |
| Green space effectiveness varies by climate | Climate-adapted species selection, monitoring |
| Gentrification/displacement despite affordability | Community land trusts, rent controls, anti-displacement reserves |
